# Reflection: Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

In this assignment, the biggest challenge was balancing the needs and priorities of different stakeholders. For instance:
- **Users** want a simple, intuitive app for managing tasks, but **admins** are concerned about system performance and scalability.
- **Security officers** prioritize data protection, which conflicts with the simplicity required for user experience.

To address these concerns, I had to prioritize core features that would provide maximum value to the users while ensuring that the system is secure and maintainable. Future iterations will focus on enhancing security and scalability while maintaining usability.
