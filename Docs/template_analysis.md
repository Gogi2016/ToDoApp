## Template Comparison

| Template Name       | Columns/Workflows                     | Automation Features                                    | Suitability for Agile Methodologies                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**     | To Do, In Progress, Done             | Manual movement of issues                             | Suitable for teams that prefer full control over task movement. Simple workflow but lacks automation. |
| **Automated Kanban** | To Do, In Progress, Done, Review, Blocked | Automatically moves issues to "Done" when all tasks in the list are completed | Ideal for teams using sprints. Automates task movement, reducing manual work and speeding up the process. Supports continuous delivery in Agile workflows. |
| **Bug Triage**       | New, In Progress, Needs Review, Done | Auto-moves issues based on labels (e.g., bug, feature) | Great for managing bugs. Not ideal for a general task management app like ToDoApp. |
| **Team Planning**    | To Do, In Progress, Review, Done     | Automates issue movement when specific criteria are met | Focuses on team collaboration. Good for feature-heavy projects but may not be as focused for simple task tracking. |
