# Template Analysis and Selection

## Template Comparison

| Template Name       | Columns/Workflows                     | Automation Features                                    | Suitability for Agile Methodologies                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**     | To Do, In Progress, Done             | Manual movement of issues                             | Suitable for teams that prefer full control over task movement. Simple workflow but lacks automation. |
| **Kanban**           | To Do, In Progress, Done, Testing, Blocked | No automation features. Tasks need to be manually moved between columns. | Ideal for smaller teams or projects that want full control over task movement without automation. Provides transparency and flexibility. |
| **Bug Triage**       | New, In Progress, Needs Review, Done | Auto-moves issues based on labels (e.g., bug, feature) | Great for managing bugs. Not ideal for a general task management app like ToDoApp. |
| **Team Planning**    | To Do, In Progress, Review, Done     | Automates issue movement when specific criteria are met | Focuses on team collaboration. Good for feature-heavy projects but may not be as focused for simple task tracking. |

## Justification for Selected Template

For this project, I chose the **Kanban** template for the following reasons:

- **Manual Task Movement**: Unlike the **Automated Kanban** template, the **Kanban** template gives full control over task movement, making it perfect for teams that prefer manually tracking progress. This allows the team to have more flexibility and intentionality with how and when tasks are moved between stages.
  
- **Simplicity and Clarity**: The **Kanban** board provides a straightforward layout with columns like **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Testing**, **Blocked**, and **Done**. It is simple to understand and use, which makes it ideal for **ToDoApp**, where tasks are clearly defined and organized by stage.

- **Customizability**: Since there is no automation, the **Kanban** template allows for the easy addition of new columns or adjustments to existing ones. For **ToDoApp**, we customized the workflow by adding a **Testing** column to ensure tasks are properly validated before being marked as complete, and a **Blocked** column to track dependencies and obstacles.
  
- **Agile Workflow**: The structure of the **Kanban** template supports the Agile principles of continuous delivery and flexibility. Tasks move incrementally from **To Do** to **In Progress** to **Testing** and finally to **Done**, ensuring a clear visualization of progress without the constraints of automation.

- **Control and Transparency**: The manual approach gives us more control over the board, ensuring that we only move tasks when they are truly ready to advance. This level of transparency ensures that the team can quickly assess the status of tasks and prioritize work more effectively.

The **Kanban** template is the most suitable choice for **ToDoApp** due to its simplicity, flexibility, and manual task management approach, allowing us to better align the tool with the projectâ€™s workflow and Agile practices.
