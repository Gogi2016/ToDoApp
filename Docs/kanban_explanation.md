# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?

A **Kanban board** is a visual tool for managing tasks and workflows. It uses **columns** to represent different stages of work, such as **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. In the context of ToDoApp, this board will help organize tasks that need to be developed, tested, and deployed, ensuring that the development process is clear, organized, and efficient.

## How is Kanban Board Visualizes Workflow

For **ToDoApp**, i’ve customized our Kanban board with the following columns:

- **To Do**: Tasks that are yet to be started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are actively being worked on.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.
- **Testing**: Tasks that are ready for testing or quality assurance.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that cannot proceed due to external dependencies or obstacles.

Each task can be moved through these columns as it progresses, providing a clear view of what’s being worked on and what’s completed.

## How the Board Supports Agile Principles

- **Transparency**: The Kanban board gives all team members a clear view of the status of each task. This supports the Agile principle of transparency by showing who is working on what and the state of each task.
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limitation**: You can set WIP limits on each column, ensuring that no team member is overwhelmed and that work flows efficiently. For example, there may be a limit on how many tasks can be in the In Progress column at any given time.
- **Flow Efficiency**: The flow from To Do to In Progress to Testing and Done aligns with Agile principles of continuous delivery and ensuring work is done incrementally

# Reflection on GitHub Kanban Board Customization

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template

Choosing the right template was crucial to managing the project efficiently. While GitHub offers several templates, the **Automated Kanban** template stood out due to its combination of simplicity and automation. However, there were some challenges in customizing it to meet the specific needs of **ToDoApp**. For example, I had to manually add columns such as **Testing** and **Blocked** to fit app’s workflow, which required careful planning to ensure the board accurately reflected the app's structure.

Another challenge was managing the automation features, which required me to ensure that tasks were properly marked as “Done” once completed. Testing these automation features took time to ensure they worked seamlessly within our workflow.

## Comparison with Other Tools (Trello, Jira)

- **GitHub Projects**: GitHub Projects provides an integrated solution for task management directly within the repository. It’s lightweight and easy to set up, which makes it ideal for smaller projects like **ToDoApp**. However, it lacks some of the advanced features found in tools like Jira, such as detailed reporting and sprint planning.
  
- **Trello**: Trello is highly flexible and visual, which makes it a great tool for managing tasks. However, its lack of native GitHub integration meant that syncing with our repository would require external tools. Additionally, Trello's free version has limitations in terms of automation, which could slow down workflows in larger projects.

- **Jira**: Jira is a robust tool used by large teams with complex workflows. It offers advanced features like sprint planning and backlog management, but it can be overwhelming for smaller projects. The learning curve is steeper compared to GitHub Projects, making it less suitable for **ToDoApp**'s relatively simple needs.

## Lessons Learned

The process of setting up the Kanban board in GitHub taught me the importance of balancing automation with flexibility. While **GitHub Projects** offers an easy-to-use solution, it's essential to customize it to fit the project’s needs—especially adding custom columns like **Testing** and **Blocked**. Additionally, learning how to automate task movement helped save time and streamline the process.

One key takeaway is that simple tools like GitHub Projects can be highly effective for smaller projects, but for more complex applications, you might want to explore tools like Jira or Trello. Nonetheless, **GitHub Projects** worked well for **ToDoApp**, providing a simple and straightforward solution for managing tasks.

In the future, I would further explore the integration of GitHub Projects with other tools to improve automation and reporting, especially if the app grows in complexity.
