# Branch Protection Rules

We use branch protection on `main` to maintain code quality and avoid introducing bugs.

## Rules Enforced
- ✅ All changes must go through Pull Requests.
- ✅ At least one team member must approve the PR.
- ✅ All CI tests must pass before merging.
- ❌ Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed.

## Why it matters
These rules:
- Encourage collaboration through peer reviews.
- Prevent broken code from reaching production.
- Align with industry best practices for DevOps and CI/CD.
