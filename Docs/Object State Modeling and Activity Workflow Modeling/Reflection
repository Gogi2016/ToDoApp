### **Challenges Faced**

1. **Balancing Detail vs. Readability**:  
   - Too many states make diagrams complex.  
   - Too few states lose critical transitions.  
2. **Aligning Diagrams with Agile User Stories**:  
   - Ensuring workflows follow sprint tasks.  
   - Keeping consistency with Kanban workflow.  

### **Comparison: State vs. Activity Diagrams**
- **State Diagrams** show object lifecycle (e.g., task progression).  
- **Activity Diagrams** focus on process flow (e.g., user interactions).  
- Both are needed for complete system modeling.
