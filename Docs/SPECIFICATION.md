# To-Do App

## Domain: Productivity Tools

### Problem Statement
The purpose of the To-Do App is to provide a simple yet effective way for users to manage their daily tasks. Many users struggle with staying organized and focused throughout the day, and a to-do app is an ideal solution. This app will allow users to track, update, and prioritize their tasks, helping them stay productive and meet their goals.

### Individual Scope
The feasibility of the To-Do App is high, as it is a relatively simple project to implement using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The app will not require any backend infrastructure or server-side databases, as it relies solely on the browserâ€™s local storage for data persistence. The app is intended for individual use, where a user can register, log in, reset their password, manage their tasks, and delete their account if needed. The project scope includes:

- User registration and login system
- Password reset functionality for users who forget their passwords
- Task management system (add, update, delete tasks)
- Account deletion functionality (delete user account and all associated data)
- Data persistence using local storage
- User interface with a clear, simple design

### Feasibility Justification
Given the simplicity of the requirements and the use of front-end technologies, the app is feasible to implement within a short time frame. The main challenge will be ensuring the user interface is intuitive and responsive. Since the app uses local storage, there is no need for a server-side backend, making the app highly feasible for development and deployment.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - The system shall allow users to register with a name, email, and password.
   - The system shall allow users to log in using their email and password.
   - The system shall allow users to reset their password via the password reset functionality.

2. **Task Management**:
   - The system shall allow users to add new tasks with a title and description.
   - The system shall allow users to edit existing tasks.
   - The system shall allow users to delete tasks.
   - The system shall allow users to mark tasks as "completed", "incomplete", or "stuck".

3. **Account Management**:
   - The system shall allow users to delete their account and all associated data permanently.

### Acceptance Criteria for Critical Requirements:
- **Task Status**: Tasks must be updated and reflected immediately in the UI without reloading the page.
- **Account Deletion**: When a user deletes their account, all associated data (tasks, preferences) must be permanently removed from local storage.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- The user interface shall be responsive and accessible on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity.

### Deployability
- The system shall be deployable on any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

### Maintainability
- The system shall use clear coding practices and be well-documented to ensure ease of maintenance.

### Scalability
- The system shall be capable of handling at least 1,000 tasks per user without performance degradation.

### Security
- User passwords shall be encrypted and stored using the latest secure hashing techniques (e.g., bcrypt).

### Performance
- Task management actions (add, update, delete) shall execute in under 2 seconds.
- The application shall load within 3 seconds for the user to interact with it.

### Reliability
- The system shall ensure that data persists across user sessions through browser local storage.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage**: Local Storage (Browser-based persistent data storage)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: None (Vanilla JavaScript for simplicity)


## System Constraints
- No backend integration (only local storage is used for persistence).
- User data is stored locally, meaning clearing browser data will remove all tasks.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement a backend with a database (Node.js with MongoDB).
- Add task categorization and priority levels.
- Enable notifications/reminders for tasks.
- Develop a mobile app version.
