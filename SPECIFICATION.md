# To-Do App

## Domain: Productivity Tools

### Problem Statement
The purpose of the To-Do App is to provide a simple yet effective way for users to manage their daily tasks. Many users struggle with staying organized and focused throughout the day, and a to-do app is an ideal solution. This app will allow users to track, update, and prioritize their tasks, helping them stay productive and meet their goals.

### Individual Scope
The feasibility of the To-Do App is high, as it is a relatively simple project to implement using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The app will not require any backend infrastructure or server-side databases, as it relies solely on the browserâ€™s local storage for data persistence. The app is intended for individual use, where a user can register, log in, reset their password, and manage their own tasks. The project scope includes:

- User registration and login system
- Password reset functionality for users who forget their passwords
- Task management system (add, update, delete tasks)
- Data persistence using local storage
- User interface with a clear, simple design

### Feasibility Justification
Given the simplicity of the requirements and the use of front-end technologies, the app is feasible to implement within a short time frame. The main challenge will be ensuring the user interface is intuitive and responsive. Since the app uses local storage, there is no need for a server-side backend, making the app highly feasible for development and deployment.


## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication:
- Users can register with a name, email, and password.
- Users can log in using their email and password.
- Users can reset their password if forgotten using the browser's local storage.

### Task Management:
- Users can add new tasks.
- Users can edit existing tasks.
- Users can update the status of tasks (Completed, Incomplete, Stuck).
- Users can delete tasks.
- Users can view their task history when they log in again.

### Logout:
- Users can log out securely.


## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability**: The UI should be simple, intuitive, and responsive. Users should be able to access the application easily from different devices.
- **Performance**: The application should work efficiently within a web browser without delays. Task operations (adding, updating, deleting) should execute instantly.
- **Security**: Passwords will be securely stored using hashing techniques. Data will persist in local storage to maintain user experience.
- **Maintainability**: The application will follow clean coding principles for easy future updates. Proper documentation will be provided for each feature.


## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage**: Local Storage (Browser-based persistent data storage)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: None (Vanilla JavaScript for simplicity)


## System Constraints
- No backend integration (only local storage is used for persistence).
- User data is stored locally, meaning clearing browser data will remove all tasks.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement a backend with a database (Node.js with MongoDB).
- Add task categorization and priority levels.
- Enable notifications/reminders for tasks.
- Develop a mobile app version.
