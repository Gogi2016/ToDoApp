Introduction
Project Title: To-Do App
Domain: Personal Productivity / Task Management
Problem Statement: The To-Do App allows users to manage their tasks, providing features such as task creation, updating status (completed, incomplete, or stuck), and tracking history. It also includes a user authentication system with registration, login, and password recovery.
Individual Scope: This app is designed to be a simple, user-friendly web application that stores tasks locally on the user's browser, ensuring the tasks remain even when the user logs out or closes the browser window. The system will be feasible to implement using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and will use the browser's local storage to store user data and tasks.
Features:
User Registration & Login: Users can register with a username and password. After logging in, they will be able to access their tasks.
Task Management:
Add tasks
Edit tasks
Update task status (Completed, Incomplete, Stuck)
Delete tasks
History: The app will store the history of tasks in the local storage, allowing users to see their past tasks when they log in again.
Password Recovery: If the user forgets their password, they can use the "Forgot Password" feature to reset it.
