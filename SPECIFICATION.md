## Introduction

## Project Title: To-Do List Application

## Domain: Productivity

## Problem Statement: 
Many users struggle to manage their daily tasks effectively, often losing track of pending work or failing to prioritize tasks. The To-Do List Application aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool to help users create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The system will allow users to register, log in, add tasks, update task status, and store task history using local storage.

## Individual Scope:
The application will be developed as a lightweight, browser-based task management system that requires no backend, making it highly feasible for solo development. It will utilize local storage for data persistence and ensure a smooth user experience through an intuitive UI. The project is realistic within the given timeframe and scope.

## Functional Requirements
  **User Authentication:**
Users can register with a name, email, and password.
Users can log in using their email and password.
Users can reset their password if forgotten (using local storage).

   **Task Management:**
Users can add new tasks.
Users can edit existing tasks.
Users can update the status of tasks (Completed, Incomplete, Stuck).
Users can delete tasks.
Users can view their task history when they log in again.

  **Logout**
Users can log out securely.

## Non-Functional Requirements

  **Usability**
The UI should be simple, intuitive, and responsive.
Users should be able to access the application easily from different devices.

  **Performance**
The application should work efficiently within a web browser without delays.
Task operations (adding, updating, deleting) should execute instantly.

 **Security**
Passwords will be securely stored using hashing techniques.
Data will persist in local storage to maintain user experience.

  **Maintainability** 
The application will follow clean coding principles for easy future updates.
Proper documentation will be provided for each feature.

## Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Storage: Local Storage (Browser-based persistent data storage)
Frameworks/Libraries: None (Vanilla JavaScript for simplicity)

## System Constraints
No backend integration (only local storage is used for persistence).
User data is stored locally, meaning clearing browser data will remove all tasks.

## Future Enhancements
Implement a backend with a database ( Node.js with MongoDB).
Add task categorization and priority levels.
Enable notifications/reminders for tasks.
Develop a mobile app version.
