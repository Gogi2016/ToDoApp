# To-Do App

Welcome to the To-Do App, your personal task management tool! This app helps you stay organized by allowing you to register, log in, reset your password, manage your tasks and delete account. Itâ€™s a simple, user-friendly application that allows you to track and organize your daily tasks.

## Features

- **Registration and Login**: Users can register an account and log in to access their personal task list.

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and update the status of your tasks.
- **Task Status**: Tasks can be marked as "complete" or "incomplete".
- **Local Storage**: All data is saved using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence between sessions.
- **Delete Account**: Account deleted will be permanently deleted on localStorage.
